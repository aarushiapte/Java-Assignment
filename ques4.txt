Question 4:

1- For this, we can use a LIST. Since they have not specified whether there will be duplicate values or not,
    assuming that names may be repeated using a List is the best option. 
    To choose an employee randomly every month we can shuffle the list and choose any record as per requirement.

2- For this use case, we can use a SET since duplicate values are not allowed and the same is not permitted in a set.

3- For this use case, we can use a MAP. A map has key value pairs so the key can have the unique employee
   names (also key cannot have duplicate values so one name will be counted only once) and the value can be 
   assigned based on the no. of employees having the same name.

4- For this, we can use a QUEUE. It will have the employees in an order and as per requirement and distribution
   of tickets they can be added and removed too.
